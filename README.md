# Advent of Code 2024 in Clojure

This is intended to be an instructional guide to using Clojure to solve the problems in AOC 2024. The code is heavily documented and I try my best to provide hints and explanations to certain features and aspects of Clojure to help new Clojure programmers assimilate into the language.

This is targeted at beginner programmers in Clojure who wants to see examples of how to solve certain programming problems in Clojure.

The reader is generally expected to know how to solve the problems themselves, so I don't explain too much on how to solve the problems (algorithms, data structures, etc.) unless it pertains to certain features of Clojure.

I highly recommend referring to the [ClojureDocs](https://clojuredocs.org/) while learning to get more detailed explanation on specific functions or macros.
